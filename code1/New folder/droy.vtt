2
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:51,052
Hi. I'm Dory.

3
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:56,097
I suffer from short-term remembory loss.

4
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:58,314
- Yes!
- That's exactly what you say!

5
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:02,234
Okay, okay.
We'll pretend to be the other kids now.

6
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,992
- Hi, Dory!
- Ahoy there!

7
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,453
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

8
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,361
Okay. I love... Okay.

9
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:13,828
We'll hide and you count and come find us.

10
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:14,702
Okay, Daddy.

11
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:19,826
No, not Daddy. I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend, okay?

12
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,168
- Okay, Daddy.
- No.

13
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:24,172
- I'm hiding.
- Now count to ten.

14
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:28,006
One, two, three...

15
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,263
Um, four...

16
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,426
Um...

17
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,684
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

18
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:39,016
Mommy, can I go play with them?

19
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,564
- Dory. Dory. Dory, honey.
- Dory. Kelpcake.

20
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,396
Undertow, sweetie.

21
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,113
Remember, honey, we have to
stay away from the undertow.

22
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,435
Okay, sweetheart,
what about that rhyme we learned?

23
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,451
# We see the undertow and we say...

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,490
# Let's go

25
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:58,695
No. It's, "Heck no."
Okay? Let's try it again.

26
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,580
# We see the undertow and we say...

27
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:03,628
# There's the undertow!

28
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,418
# There's the undertow
There is the undertow

29
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:10,586
# Hey, you found the undertow
And we see the undertow #

30
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,048
- Did I forget again?
- No, no. No.

31
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,967
- No, sweetie. Don't worry about it.
- No biggie, kelpcake.

32
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:24,478
What if I forget you?
Would you ever forget me?

33
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,608
Oh, kelpcake, no.

34
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:31,573
We will never forget you, Dory.
And we know you'll never forget us.

35
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,323
Hello?

36
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,781
Hello!

37
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,489
- Did you hear that?
- What's that? Hear what?

38
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,199
- Stan, I just heard someone say hello.
- I didn't hear anybody say hello.

39
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,001
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.

40
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,301
There's a lot of fish here.
Anybody could have just said hello.

41
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,631
- Hello?
- There.

42
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,131
- Where?
- There. There. Right there.

43
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:34,378
- Where am I looking?
- There!

44
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,429
- Oh.
- Hello!

45
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,351
- Hello?
- Oh, my goodness, it's a child!

46
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,719
- Hi, kid. Over here. Hello?
- Hello? Hi.

47
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,560
Hi. I'm Dory. Can you please help me?

48
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:49,476
Hi, Dory. Are you lost?

49
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,107
- Yeah, where are your parents?
- Um...

50
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,031
I can't remember.

51
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:55,904
- Oh.
- Well we'll look around.

52
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,857
Are any of these fish your parents?

53
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,831
Hi, I'm Dory. Can you please help me?

54
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,325
- What?
- Um...

55
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,341
- Honey, you just said that.
- Mmm.

56
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,884
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,930
I'm sorry. I suffer from
short-term remembory loss.

58
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,854
- Oh, how awful.
- Short-term memory loss?

59
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,774
Okay, you wait here for one second.
Okay, sweetie pie?

60
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,350
- Stan. Stan. Stan.
- What? What?

61
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,018
What do we do? The poor thing is lost!

62
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,187
- What do you want me to do?
- We have to do something.

63
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:34,186
- She can't remember a thing!
- She could come from anywhere.

64
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:38,859
Wow, you are no help today.
Dory? Sweetie? How about we...

65
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,950
She's gone.
Well, that's not good. Hey, Dory!

66
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,236
- Dory!
- Dory!

67
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:49,246
I'm Dory. I lost my family.
Can you help me?

68
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,131
I'm Dory. I suffer from
short-term memory...

69
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:04,885
# Just keep swimming
Just keep swimming

70
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:09,136
# Just keep swimming
Swimming What do we do? #

71
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:18,356
Hi. I lost my family. Can you help me?

72
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,904
Where did you see them last?

73
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:24,031
Well, uh, funny story, but I forgot.

74
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,078
Oh, sweetie,
do you want to come swim with us?

75
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:29,214
That is the nicest offer
I've gotten all day.

76
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,248
I think. Uh, I can't remember.

77
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,246
Anyhoo, thanks,
but I'm looking for someone.

78
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,127
Oh. Can't remember. Can't remember.
Can't remember.

79
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,385
Hi! I'm Dory.

80
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,759
Was it something I said?

81
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,929
Kidding. Okay, you're not coming back.

82
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:52,807
I was looking for something and I...
Okay, get it. Date night. Have fun.

83
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,021
Well, I hope you find whatever it is
you're looking for.

84
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,860
You and me both. Any idea what that was?

85
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,447
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,490
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:07,622
Okay. Guess we'll hang out another
time. Don't be a stranger, Stranger.

88
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,134
Huh?

89
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,712
A white boat! They took my son!

90
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,665
My son! Help me! Please!

91
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,798
Watch out!

92
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,215
Oh! Oh, sorry! Are you okay?

93
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,135
- He's gone. He's gone.
- There, there.

94
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,347
- No, he's gone.
- It's all right.

95
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,806
- He's gone.
- It'll be okay.

96
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:35,016
No, no, they took him away.
I have to find the boat.

97
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,194
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat!

98
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,396
- You have?
- Uh-huh.

99
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,153
It went this way! Follow me!

100
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:43,318
Thank you! Thank you. Thank you so much!

101
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:01,381
Klaus. Klaus, the pinata's drooping.

102
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:09,056
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
I can fix it. Ow!

103
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,942
Hey, Marlin?

104
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,479
Oh. Hey, guys, I was just...

105
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,566
Ow! Ow! Ow!

106
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:25,861
Dory! It's not time to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.

107
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,200
And remember, the anemone stings.

108
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,616
Oh, right. Yeah. Sorry.
Back to bed, back to bed.

109
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,541
Hey, Marlin? Ow!

110
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,207
Back to bed! That was it.
Very simple. Bed. Back to it.

111
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:40,335
Mmm, got it.

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,800
Hey, Marlin?

113
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,125
And we're up. That's it.
Ready to start the day.

114
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,390
- And we were looking for something.
- Nemo.

115
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,934
Right. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

116
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,928
Of course, I don't really remember
yesterday all that well.

117
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,982
Anyway, I would say the scariest
moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.

118
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,903
Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.

119
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,395
No. No, there were definitely four.

120
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,988
But last time you told it,
there were three.

121
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,572
Son, which one of us travelled
across the entire ocean?

122
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,278
Nemo did.

123
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,075
Obviously we had to cross the ocean...

124
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,162
to find him, so you know... He went first.

125
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,581
I guess that's true. Isn't it?

126
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,964
Well, you made it!
You almost missed the field trip.

127
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,590
A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips.
Where are we going?

128
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,757
- I thought you told her.
- I did tell her!

129
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,596
- Uh... Dory.
- Yeah.

130
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:35,931
Mr Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.

131
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Uh-huh.

132
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:42,904
So it would be best if today
you weren't exactly with the class.

133
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,074
Oh. Why not?

134
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,321
Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

135
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,196
That's the one thing I can remember. Yes.

136
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:53,332
Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.

137
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:57,499
And Mr Ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.

138
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,502
In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.

139
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,125
Poor guy. You know, he's so overworked.

140
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,714
- You understand.
- I totally understand now.

141
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:05,297
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,723
He wants me to be the teacher's assistant.

143
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,932
Uh... No, not exactly.

144
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,971
I am so honoured. I have never been
a teaching assistant before.

145
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,473
Mr Ray! You got help.

146
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,654
Oh. Okeydokey.

147
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,478
- All right, kids.
- All right, kids.

148
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,069
- Today's the day!
- Today's the day!

149
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,823
Our field trip to the sting ray migration.

150
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:29,736
Sting ray migration.

151
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,994
Now, does anyone know why we migrate?

152
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,198
Come on. You got to know this stuff.

153
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,118
Migration is about going back to...

154
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,294
- Bed!
- Yes!

155
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:40,162
- No.
- No.

156
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:44,341
- The sand!
- No! Migration is about going home.

157
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,002
- Home.
- Which is where you're from.

158
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,840
Where you're from.

159
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,094
Can someone tell me where they're from?

160
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:51,514
- I live by a giant rock.
- I live 3 coral caves away from here.

161
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,176
My house is covered in algae.

162
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,684
Where'd you grow up, Dory?

163
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,845
Me? Um, I don't know.

164
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,893
My family. Where are they?

165
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,026
Can I help you?

166
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,779
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
You see, I suffer from...

167
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,525
Short-term memory loss.

168
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,275
How can you remember your family
if you have short-term memory loss?

169
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,907
Good question. See, I can remember
some things because well...

170
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,709
They make sense.
Like, um, I have a family.

171
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,333
I know because I've... I must have
come from somewhere. Right?

172
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,539
Everyone has a family.

173
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,917
I may not remember their names
and what they look like.

174
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,298
And I may not even be able to
ever find them again, but, um...

175
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,637
- What were we talking about?
- Mommies and daddies.

176
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,390
Mommies and daddies. Right.

177
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:40,394
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh!

178
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,268
That class. Uh-oh. Why me? Okay.

179
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:46,226
You guys seem a little young,
but, um, okay.

180
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,067
You see, kids,
when two fish love each other...

181
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,443
And we'll stop right there.

182
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,742
Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration song coming on.

183
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:01,447
Oh...

184
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:05,079
# Migration, migration
let's learn about migration

185
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:09,089
# It's nature's inspiration
to move around the sea

186
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,173
# Here's a scientific promise
That a fish who's Oceanodromous

187
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,260
# Where did everyone go? I'm by myself
Oh, there they are. I'm back

188
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,468
# Plus or minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning #

189
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,309
Oh, kids stay away from the edge.

190
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,595
Okay, you hear that? Okay, everybody
stay back from the edge. Come on.

191
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,439
- Okay, that's too far.
- That's too far.

192
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,524
Come on. Come on.
Get back over here. Back this way.

193
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,776
- Now, I need everyone to listen to me.
- All right, listen up!

194
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,452
- When the rays pass through here...
- The rays, gonna pass through.

195
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,282
What do we have to be careful of?

196
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,947
Everybody has to be careful of what? Hmm?

197
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,445
- The undertow!
- That's right.

198
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,164
That's right. The under... The undertow?

199
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:49,127
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.

200
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,463
And if you're not careful,
you can get pulled into...

201
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,669
Mr Ray! So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?

202
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,970
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.

203
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:01,314
Something deep inside you that feels
so familiar that you have to listen to it.

204
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:07,232
Like a song you've always known.
And I can hear mine now!

205
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:09,653
# To and fro, our hearts know where to go

206
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,654
# Beating like a drum
it sends us back to where we're from

207
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,994
# Oh... we're going home

208
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,413
# We know who we are...

209
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,659
# And it's time to travel far

210
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:23,664
# For days and nights we'll roam,
to make our way back home

211
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:26,618
# Oh... we're going home

212
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,917
- # Swimming to and fro,
- Wow!

213
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,839
# Our hearts know where to go

214
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,088
# Beating like a drum, it sends us back
to where we're from #

215
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:37,965
We see the undertow and we say...

216
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,090
Dory!

217
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,176
Dory!

218
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,467
Dory! Dory!

219
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,186
- Is she dead?
- No, she's not dead.

220
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,691
- Aw. Oh, man.
- Give her some space, everybody.

221
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:54,824
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

222
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,532
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California?

223
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,357
I remembered something so I...

224
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,618
I remembered something!

225
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,331
I actually remembered something!
Something important.

226
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,451
Something important? What? What was it?

227
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:10,367
Uh... I'm not sure any more,
but I can still feel it. It's right there.

228
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,041
All right, thank you, Mr Ray.

229
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,629
Okay, come on. Try to remember better.
Don't be such a Dory, Dory.

230
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,586
Hmm. I don't know. I... Hold on. Hold on.

231
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,854
- Uh... Oh. Oh!
- What? Did you remember?

232
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,385
Ugh, I don't remember.
It was something... It was...

233
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,636
Oh, oh, oh! It was something about the...

234
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,727
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

235
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,895
My family! I remember my family!

236
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,895
They're out there somewhere.
I have to find them.

237
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,568
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys! Guys! Hello?

238
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,662
Guys! Where are you?

239
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,081
- Dory!
- Hello?

240
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,582
- Dory!
- Ah! Where did you go?

241
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,922
- You were the one to go.
- My parents. I remembered them.

242
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,501
What? What did you remember?

243
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,746
I remembered them! My mom. My dad.

244
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,759
I have a family. Oh! They don't know
where I am. Let's go. We have to go.

245
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:02,343
Dory, no. No! This is crazy!
Where exactly are you trying to go?

246
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,969
To the Gem of the Baltic?

247
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,467
- The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
- Yes!

248
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,728
No, Dory. California's all the way
across the ocean.

249
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,850
Then we'd better get going.

250
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:14,765
How come every time we're on the edge
of this reef, one of us is trying...

251
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,609
to leave?
For once, can't we just enjoy the view?

252
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,355
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family?

253
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:23,656
No! We've done our ocean travels.
That part of our lives is over.

254
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,122
The only reason to travel
in the first place is so...

255
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,453
- you don't have to travel ever again.
- Yeah, but I want to...

256
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,750
- Dory, look...
- Please.

257
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:37,285
All I know is that I miss them.

258
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,720
I really, really miss them.
I didn't know what that felt like.

259
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,465
Do you know what that feels like?

260
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:55,647
Yes, I know what that feels like.

261
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:02,901
I don't want to forget this.
Somewhere out there is my family.

262
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,239
Please, Marlin,
I can't find them on my own.

263
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,660
I'll forget.
Please help me find my family.

264
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,420
Yeah, Dad, you can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?

265
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,134
No.

266
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,594
But I know a guy.

267
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,140
Whoo-hoo!

268
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,809
Righteous, righteous, righteous!

269
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,493
Totally sick. Totally sick.

270
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,081
I know. Isn't it great?

271
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,576
No! I'm gonna be totally sick.

272
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:59,539
It's the California current, dude.
It's got some gnarly chop.

273
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,170
Surf's up, dude!

274
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,215
Hey, dude, if you're gonna hurl,
just do me a solid...

275
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,432
head to the back of the shell,
lean out, and go for distance.

276
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,604
We call that "feeding the fishes."

277
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:11,933
Correctamundo, Squirt!

278
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,977
And now we're looking for my parents
at the Brooch of the Atlantic? Or the...

279
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,150
- The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
- Exactly!

280
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,688
How are you gonna find your parents?

281
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,645
Do you remember what they look like?

282
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,614
I'm a bit new to the memory thing,
so I can't say for sure...

283
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,402
but something tells me they were
mostly blue, with s... Maybe yellow.

284
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,241
That sounds right.

285
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,985
Also I'm pretty sure I'm gonna know
them when I see them. We're family.

286
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,867
By the way crossing the ocean
is the kind of thing you should...

287
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,037
only do once. One time!

288
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,626
Morro Bay, California's coming up, dudes.

289
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,921
Whoo-hoo! Let's find my family.

290
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,247
Go! Go! Go, go, go.

291
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,671
- Just go, Dad.
- Don't push me, Nemo.

292
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,139
Whoo-hoo!

293
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,601
So long, Little Blue!
Hope you find your parents.

294
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,596
And good luck "feeding the fishes."

295
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,604
Too late. Already fed.

296
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:01,979
Oh.

297
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,451
This feels familiar. Mom! Dad!

298
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,373
No. Dory! Dory! Wait! Wait.

299
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,946
Mom! Dad!

300
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,698
Stop yelling for a second.
Do you really think your parents...

301
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,247
are just gonna be floating around here
waiting for you?

302
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,674
Well, I don't know, but there's only
one way to find out. Mom! Dad!

303
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,455
- Yell louder, Dory.
- Mom! Dad!

304
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,339
- Sh!
- What was that?

305
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:32,755
Wait. I've heard that before.
I remember someone saying, "Sh."

306
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,888
Yes, well done. That was me.
One minute ago.

307
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:35,642
Sh!

308
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,689
Please. Have you seen my mommy and daddy?

309
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,113
Their names are Jenny and Charlie.

310
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:43,858
Sh!

311
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,904
Jenny and Charlie.

312
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:48,856
What? Jenny and what?

313
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,864
Those are their names!
My parents are Jenny and Charlie!

314
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,570
- Dory, wait!
- Jenny!

315
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,987
Can't we just take a moment
to come up with a plan?

316
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,450
- Jenny! Charlie!
- Sh!

317
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,830
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry, she's a little excited.

318
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,708
- Jenny! Charlie!
- Dory, stop yelling for a second.

319
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,504
It's not a good idea
to come into a new neighbourhood...

320
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,050
and call this much attention to yourself.

321
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:12,184
You don't understand. I remembered
my parent's names! Jenny! Charlie!

322
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:16,012
These crabs are locals and I
get the feeling they're shushing...

323
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,850
us for a reason. You might wake up
something dangerous.

324
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,064
Are you talking about like
something with one big eye...

325
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,096
tentacles, and a snappy thing?

326
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,857
Well, that's very specific,
but something like that, yes.

327
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,022
You just in general don't want to...

328
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,568
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

329
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:37,198
There's a mistake. We're backing away.
Let us live and we will...

330
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,867
We'll worship you. We'll build a...
Do you like a monument?

331
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:54,295
Oh! Ooh! Whoa! Swim for your life!

332
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,355
- Nemo!
- Nemo!

333
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,323
Dad!

334
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,527
- Nemo!
- Dad!

335
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,746
No!

336
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,254
Nemo, hold on to me and don't let go!

337
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:27,924
Dad!

338
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,247
No, no! No!

339
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,224
Dory! Dory, slow down!
We're not being chased any more.

340
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,258
Are you sure?

341
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,437
Jenny and Charlie. Jenny and Charlie!

342
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,109
I just remembered their names!
We have to keep going. We're so close.

343
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,404
- Huh?
- Nemo, are you hurt?

344
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:55,105
Oh, my goodness! Nemo!
Are you okay? What happened?

345
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,949
- Not now, Dory. Please!
- Oh, no.

346
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,454
- Nemo. Oh, no. Oh, no.
- I'm okay.

347
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,576
Oh, Nemo. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry.

348
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,963
Oh, my goodness! Nemo, are you okay?

349
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,082
I said, "Not now." You've done enough.

350
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:12,499
I have? Oh, no. But I can fix it.
I can. I'll go get help.

351
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,131
You know what you can do, Dory?
You can go wait over there.

352
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,889
Go wait over there and forget.
It's what you do best.

353
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,470
You're right. I don't know why I thought
I could do this.

354
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:29,021
Find my family. I can't do this.
I'm so sorry. I'll fix it.

355
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,937
- I'm okay.
- Well, I'm gonna get help. Okay?

356
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:35,146
Okay? I can do that. I'll be...
It'll be all right, Nemo.

357
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,660
Hello? Someone? Hello?

358
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,704
Anyone? Hello? Anyone?

359
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,329
Hello.

360
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,866
- Hello?
- I'm Sigourney Weaver.

361
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,881
Oh. Hi, Sigourney. I need your help.

362
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,002
Won't you please join us...

363
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,549
Oh. Great, great, great.

364
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,974
As we explore the wonders
of the Pacific Ocean...

365
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,394
and the amazing life it holds within.

366
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,724
Witness the majesty of the Beluga Whale.

367
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,350
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?

368
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,515
Dory! There you are!

369
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,354
Guys! I found help. Sigourney Weaver's
gonna tell us where we are.

370
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,690
Look out!

371
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,515
- Oh, look at this!
- No respect for ocean life.

372
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,859
- Marlin! Nemo!
- Dory!

373
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,065
No, no, no. Not again! Not again!

374
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,735
Let's take her inside
and see how she does.

375
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,369
Dory! Dory!

376
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:27,203
Don't worry, Dory! Stay calm.
We'll come find you!

377
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,870
And welcome to
the Marine Life Institute...

378
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,250
where we believe in Rescue,
Rehabilitation and Release.

379
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,045
Marlin? Nemo?

380
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,178
Hello? Hello? Can you help me?

381
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,178
Me help you?

382
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,893
Ugh.

383
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:52,895
Oh.

384
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,361
Huh? What's happening? Help?

385
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,687
Looks like we're done here.

386
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,111
Dude, cut it out. You're a scientist.
We talked about this.

387
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,620
Oh, come on. It's funny.

388
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,456
Oh, boy. Okay. This is...

389
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,881
I'll be fine, I just need to find
a way out and...

390
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:26,929
If I could just... Get a hold
of yourself, get a hold of yourself.

391
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,927
You'll be fine, everything's fine,
think positively.

392
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,850
- Hey, you.
- Oh.

393
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:32,807
Spinner.

394
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,438
Oh, thank goodness. Hi, I'm Dory. I'm...

395
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,484
Name's Hank. How sick are you?

396
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,779
Sick? I'm sick?

397
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:39,942
Why else would you be in quarantine?

398
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,070
Oh, no! How long do I have?
I have to find my family.

399
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,815
All right. Now don't get hysterical...
Uh-oh. Not good.

400
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,620
What? What is it? What happened?
What's that?

401
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,334
That there is bad news.

402
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,829
It's a transport tag for fish
who can't cut it inside the institute.

403
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:56,128
They get transferred to permanent digs.
An aquarium.

404
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,883
In Cleveland.

405
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,180
Fish in here, go back in the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.

406
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,932
Cleveland? No!
I can't go to the Cleveland.

407
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,934
I have to get to the Jewel of Morro Bay,
California and find my family.

408
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,927
That's this place.
The Marine Life Institute.

409
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,847
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
You're here.

410
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,154
You mean I'm from here?

411
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,646
My parents are here.
I have to get to them.

412
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,024
So what exhibit are you from?

413
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,150
Wait. I'm from an exhibit?
Which one? I have to get there.

414
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,449
Hmm. That's a hard one, kid.

415
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:28,783
Unless... Nah. Never work. It's too crazy.

416
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,949
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.

417
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,117
You know, I could see that?
Well, there's one thing I can think of...

418
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,209
to help you get to your family.
If I just take...

419
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,455
Yes! Great idea. You take me to find them.

420
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,634
Why didn't I think of that?

421
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,665
Uh, no, no, no. If I just take your tag...

422
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,510
I can take your place on the transport
truck then you can go back inside...

423
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,847
and find your family.
All you have to do is give me the tag.

424
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,064
What tag? There's a tag on my fin!

425
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,643
How could you forget
you have a tag on your fin?

426
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,689
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I...
I suffer from short-term memory loss.

427
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,113
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

428
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,903
Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

429
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,858
Um, you were about to give me your tag.

430
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,161
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

431
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,203
So I can go to...

432
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,329
So I can go to Cleveland.

433
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,834
Cleveland? Mmm. I hear good things
about Cleveland. Why do you want to go?

434
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,167
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

435
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,504
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

436
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,261
I just want to live in a glass box alone.

437
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,053
That's all I want. So give me your tag!

438
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,548
Hey, man, don't touch my tag!

439
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,522
Look...

440
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,896
I don't work here.
It's not like I have a map of this place.

441
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,276
A map! Good idea.

442
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,492
You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh, boy.

443
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,116
All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me...

444
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,872
I don't have much. Um, I...
How about if I give you this tag?

445
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,365
Great idea.

446
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,629
Are you absolutely sure
that's what I said?

447
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,588
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."

448
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,759
- Yeah, Dad.
- I said that?

449
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,717
You said that, Dory swam to the surface,

450
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,104
and she got taken by some...

451
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,394
All right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

452
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,767
I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that...

453
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,765
I'm not positive I did.
It's actually a compliment because...

454
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,939
I asked her to wait and I said,
"It's what you do best."

455
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:29,109
So I... Oh, it's my fault!

456
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,119
It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.

457
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,913
What if it's a restaurant?

458
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,406
Oy! You two! Shut it!

459
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,419
Yeah, we're trying to sleep!
You interrupted my favourite dream!

460
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,293
Is that the one about you
laying on this rock?

461
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,800
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is a good one.

462
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,632
- Oh, yeah, isn't it? Yeah.
- It's one of my favourites.

463
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,467
Uh, excuse us. Hello!

464
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,298
- Son! Son.
- We're trying to...

465
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,643
Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.

466
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:53,852
They could pounce at any moment.

467
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,599
Uh, they don't look very pouncy.

468
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,306
That's what they want you to think.

469
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,146
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.

470
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,732
Excuse me, we're worried
about our friend. Is that a restaurant?

471
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,652
Mate, it's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.

472
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,950
- She is?
- It's a fish hospital.

473
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:17,374
Sigourney Weaver says she'll be
rescued, rehabilitated, and released.

474
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,535
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.

475
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,294
- Nasal parasite.
- Anaemia.

476
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,036
All fixed up and sent on our way.

477
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,246
Oh, thank goodness.

478
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,376
Sure, that's all right.
Don't you worry ab...

479
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,634
- Gerald, get off the rock!
- Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off!

480
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,680
- Get off! Now you know better! Off!
- Off! Off! Off! Off!

481
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:40,675
Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the Marine Life Institute.

482
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,940
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

483
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,941
She was right.

484
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,191
It looks like Dory
can do something besides forget.

485
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,147
Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that.

486
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,357
So how are we gonna get inside?

487
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,026
Wait. You want to get inside MLI?

488
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,866
Desperately. Our friend is in there.
Lost, alone.

489
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,202
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.

490
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,408
Oh, we know a way.

491
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,708
You do?

492
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:05,251
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo. Ooo-roo.

493
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,205
- What are they doing?
- I don't know. It sounds bad.

494
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,342
- Are we there yet?
- Sh. Keep it down!

495
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,296
Hank, I'm so glad I found you.
It feels like... I... Destiny.

496
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,352
For what must be the millionth time,
it's not destiny.

497
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,773
Uh-oh. Have I said "destiny" before?
I'm sorry.

498
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,022
I'm just so nervous
because I'm gonna meet my parents.

499
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,404
I haven't seen them in I don't even know
how long because...

500
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,732
- you see I suffer from short-term...
- Short-term memory loss.

501
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,517
Look, no more talking. Okay?
I don't like talking.

502
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,071
I don't like chatter and questions.
And, "How are you? Oh, I'm fine."

503
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,408
"How are you? I'm fine too."
News flash -nobody's fine.

504
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,527
Oh, I'm fine. How are you?

505
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,615
- Hank, look, there's a map!
- Sh!

506
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,412
The plan is you're gonna read that
and figure out where your parents live.

507
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,409
Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland.
You got it?

508
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,751
Got it. What was the first part again?

509
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,206
Ugh.

510
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,424
What? The octopus escaped again?

511
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:52,134
Wow. Look at all the exhibits.

512
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,255
How can you do this park in one day?
Seriously.

513
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,724
- Pick one!
- Okay. Um...

514
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,429
Well, tell everyone to keep an eye out.

515
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,215
We're supposed to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.

516
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,597
Well, of course I haven't seen him.
If I was looking I'd find him.

517
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,690
Hank! There you are.

518
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,324
- Hurry up!
- Okay. Okay.

519
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:16,742
K. It starts with a "k."
Kid z-own-y. Kid zone!

520
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,815
No! No kids. Kids grab things.

521
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,777
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.

522
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,490
You lost a tentacle?
Well then you're not an octopus,

523
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:24,828
you're a septopus.

524
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,326
I may not remember, but I can count.

525
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,787
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

526
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,376
Journey to the... Hey, look. Shells.

527
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,383
Hey, look. Shells!

528
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,471
Daddy, here's a shell for you.

529
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,135
That's great, Dory. You found another one.

530
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,354
- I did?
- Oh, yes, you did.

531
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,934
You're getting good at this, Dory.

532
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,482
Hey, look. Shells!

533
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,070
- Hey, I live there.
- Yes! Yes, indeed.

534
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:57,492
- I like shells.
- That's right, dear.

535
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,315
Do you think you could find me
another shell?

536
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,663
Purple ones are my favourite.

537
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,157
Okay, Mommy.

538
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,631
Mommy. Purple shell. Purple shell!
Hey, my home had a purple shell.

539
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,165
So what? Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.

540
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,169
No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.

541
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,931
Purple shells were her favourite
and she had this adorable giggle.

542
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,302
And then my dad was really friendly.

543
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,850
And now your wacky memory's
gonna get us caught.

544
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,484
Still think this is destiny?

545
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,154
- Hank, we have to find my folks!
- Quiet!

546
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,240
Ugh. Base, this is Carol.

547
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,526
Uh, I think I might have found
that missing octopus. Over.

548
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,906
- See what you did?
- Sorry.

549
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,408
This could not be worse.

550
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,749
Hmm. "Destiny." Destiny.

551
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,547
- Hank. I got a feeling.
- Sh!

552
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,710
I think we should get in the bucket.

553
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,049
- No. Stop.
- Seriously. It says "destiny" and it is...

554
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,755
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We've got to get in that bucket.

555
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:05,183
- I'm not going with you in that bucket.
- Here... I... go... in... the... bucket. Bye.

556
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:12,398
Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family.
Oh, good idea. Play dead.

557
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,490
I'm sorry. I got to blink. How do you
hold your eyes open that long?

558
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,790
Hey, guys. Wait a second.

559
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,603
Our next guest
has been here a very long time.

560
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,773
She's a whale shark. Her name is Destiny.

561
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,142
Destiny? Really?

562
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,308
You'll notice she's extremely
near-sighted and has trouble...

563
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,730
navigating her environment.
Oh! And here she comes now.

564
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,359
Ooh! Destiny. You're a fish?

565
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,699
Wait. What?

566
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,834
- Hi! Hello there.
- Whoa! Oh. Whoa.

567
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,957
All right, I'll go with you.

568
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,291
- Excuse me.
- Is that blue blob talking?

569
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,798
- Can you help me? I lost my family.
- You lost your family?

570
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,212
Well, it's a long story,

571
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,007
and truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.

572
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,722
- Aw, that is so sad.
- You poor thi...

573
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:31,467
Sorry. Not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.

574
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,061
Oh, I think you swim beautifully.

575
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,142
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.

576
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,021
Thank you.

577
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,646
You're welcome.

578
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,936
Wait. Say that again.

579
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,987
Um, you're welcome.

580
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,663
- Dory?
- Yes.

581
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:46,822
- Dory?
- Yes.

582
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:47,908
- Dory?
- Yes.

583
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,622
- Dory!
- Yes.

584
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,912
- You and I were friends!
- No!

585
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,996
- Dory, it's me! Destiny!
- You know me?

586
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,833
Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.

587
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,629
- We were pipe pals!
- We were?

588
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,050
- Aw, you're so pretty.
- So you know where I'm from?

589
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,093
Yep, you are from the Open Ocean exhibit.

590
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,010
I'm from the Open Ocean exhibit?

591
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,755
Then that's where my parents are.

592
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,104
We got to go. Can you take me there?

593
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,932
Uh... Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

594
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:15,388
Can you please keep it down
over there? My head hurts.

595
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,476
Who's that?

596
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,601
That's my neighbour, Bailey.

597
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,017
He was brought in with a head injury.

598
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,268
I know you're talking about me, Destiny.

599
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,569
He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...

600
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,783
the doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

601
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,864
Hear every word you're saying about me.

602
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,028
What's echolocation?

603
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:31,117
Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...

604
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:36,334
find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."

605
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,285
Now I know you're talking about me.

606
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,214
- I really can't echolocate.
- Oh.

607
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,086
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

608
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,303
I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!

609
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,764
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

610
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,675
Echolocation.

611
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,310
Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?

612
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,558
- What?
- What are glasses?

613
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,471
It's sort of like you go, "hoo"

614
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,348
and then you see things.
Why do I know that?

615
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,897
Oh. That's interesting.

616
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,276
There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.

617
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,954
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

618
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,163
Wait, no. I know where my parents are.
They're in the...

619
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,164
What's it called? The place...
The soap and lotion?

620
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,997
- Open Ocean.
- Open Ocean!

621
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,622
Open Ocean! I know where that is.

622
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,919
That's the exhibit located right next to...
I don't care.

623
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:22,924
Easy!

624
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,922
If you're trying to get to the Open Ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.

625
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,298
- Through the pipes. Great.
- Through the pipes?

626
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,466
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

627
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:34,715
Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's...
Did you get that, Hank? All that?

628
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,767
- Uh, yeah.
- Great! Let's go.

629
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:40,346
I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.

630
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Um...

631
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:49,146
That's... I'm... I... See, I can't because
I'm not so good with directions.

632
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,370
Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?

633
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,491
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

634
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,499
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

635
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,540
- Not my problem. Tag!
- But I can't get in that way.

636
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,665
- I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
- There's no other way.

637
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,968
- There's no other way.
- Now, now. Don't panic.

638
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:13,181
It's okay. Not everything in life is
easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?

639
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:17,474
She's right. When something's
too hard, you should just give up.

640
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,560
- Charlie!
- A joke. I'm kidding!

641
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,345
Just a joke. A joke.
Caution, joker at work.

642
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:24,811
Joke. I got it.

643
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:28,151
You see, kelpcake?
There's always another way.

644
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,704
Thank you, Daddy.

645
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,489
Thank you, Daddy.

646
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,163
Nope. My father said
there's always another way.

647
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,833
- What? There is no other way.
- Open Ocean. Open Ocean. Hmm...

648
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,083
Open Ocean. I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.

649
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,416
That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.

650
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,546
- Wait, what?
- Always another way. There's...

651
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:53,684
There! Guys, follow me.
I know how we can get to locomotion.

652
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,183
- Open Ocean.
- Exactly.

653
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:59,518
Um, guys.
You know I can't swim over there, right?

654
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,193
Ooo-roo, ooo-roo, ooo-roo.

655
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,596
I don't see how this
is going to get us inside.

656
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:06,938
What are you even doing?

657
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,856
We're calling her over, of course.

658
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,775
Calling her over? Calling who over?

659
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,618
Lads, meet Becky.

660
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:23,462
Flying? No, no, no new information.

661
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,082
Listen, tell her thank you.

662
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,377
You guys have gone
above and beyond. Really.

663
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:31,763
But is there a way to get in
that involves, like, swimming?

664
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,222
Because that's really our strength.

665
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,012
Look, your friend is going to be
in quarantine.

666
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,045
That's where they take the sick fish.

667
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,814
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.

668
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,345
Hi, Becky.

669
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,267
Ow! Stop. Let's call
her Pecky because this is hurting.

670
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,780
I think she likes you, Dad.

671
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:55,911
Becky, love? These two nice fish
need to get into quarantine.

672
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,912
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?

673
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:01,792
Becky, is... Would that work
with your schedule? Ow!

674
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,702
She doesn't understand what I'm saying.

675
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,419
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.

676
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,170
- Imp... What?
- Imprint.

677
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:12,424
Look her in the eye and say, "ooo-roo"
and she'll be in sync with you.

678
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,668
- Now look her in the eye.
- Yeah.

679
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:19,758
Nemo, I think we should
devise an alternate plan.

680
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,599
One that involves staying in the water
and someone sane.

681
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:25,805
Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!

682
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,766
That's fine, Dad. And in the meantime,
Dory will just forget us.

683
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,818
Like you said, it's what she does best.

684
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,611
Fine.

685
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,033
Uh...

686
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:39,571
Okay, look her in the eye. Which eye?

687
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,948
Just pick one, mate.

688
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:41,947
Becky.

689
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,036
Uh...

690
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:51,919
Ooh. Ooo-roo. Roo-roo, Becky.

691
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,172
Okay, this is all great.

692
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,554
How exactly is Becky supposed to carry us?

693
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,469
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Gerald!

694
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,231
- Hmm?
- Yeah, Gerald.

695
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,813
- Come on, son.
- Hmm?

696
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,820
Come on, Gerald. Give us your pail,
we'll let you sit on the rock.

697
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,653
- Yeah, Gerald. We swear it.
- Hmm.

698
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:21,237
That's right. Shimmy on over here.

699
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,407
Come on. You can do it.

700
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,240
That's right.

701
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,871
Mind you don't scuff your bum.

702
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,415
Thank you so much, Gerald.

703
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,205
Welcome to your time on this rock.

704
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,375
Comfortable, isn't it?

705
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,758
Time's up! Get off!

706
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,603
- Off! Off! Off! Off!
- Time's up! Now get off, Gerald! Off!

707
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,310
No, this is nuts! Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?

708
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,483
Good luck!

709
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:54,902
Okay, when I tell you you're gonna...

710
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,935
Yeah. I know. I'm gonna signal
with a big splash.

711
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:01,199
On my mark. Not clear yet. Not clear yet.

712
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,406
- Now?
- Not 'til Destiny gives the signal.

713
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,081
You know something? I have no idea
why you're even doing this.

714
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:11,036
What do you mean?

715
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,037
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.

716
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,039
If I had short-term memory loss...

717
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,051
I'd just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.

718
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,883
Well I don't want to do that.
I want my family.

719
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,088
Not me, kid. I don't want anyone
to worry about.

720
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:25,554
You're lucky. No memories. No problems.

721
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,641
Huh. No memories. No problems.

722
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,141
Still not clear. Still not clear.

723
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,651
You don't have to say when it's not time.

724
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,152
- Not...
- Just tell me when it is time.

725
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,074
Okay, here we go. And... Wait!

726
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,902
"Here we go. Wait." Are you serious?

727
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,688
- Okay, on the count of three.
- Don't count. Just say, "Go."

728
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,569
- Go! Now, now. Do it! Do it!
- What? Okay, okay.

729
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,445
- Wow. Look at that! I mean...
- That's the signal.

730
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,494
Go, go, go! That's the signal!

731
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,174
Now remember,
Destiny said follow the signs

732
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,920
- to the Open Ocean exhibit.
-Uh-huh.

733
00:38:57,086 --> 00:39:00,586
I can't see squat,
so it's your job to look for it.

734
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,586
Got it. Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

735
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:03,628
I'm just gonna repeat it, okay?
That should work.

736
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,968
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

737
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:10,176
Mm. Go right! Follow the signs
to Open Ocean.

738
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,769
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Left!

739
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,846
- Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
- And steer clear of people, will you?

740
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,191
Especially kids.
I don't want to be touched.

741
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,823
Sh! Do not mess me up!

742
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:25,864
Oh, poor baby.
Let me get that for you. Here you... Oh!

743
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,446
Oh, my. Ugh.

744
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,445
Where do we go? Where do we go?

745
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,500
Oh, sorry! Okay, I was looking, looking...

746
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,415
Roo-roo, Becky!
Drop us anywhere. We're okay.

747
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,673
Just wait, Dad. I think she's looking
for a place to land.

748
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,508
She's confused, Nemo. She doesn't
even know which way to look.

749
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:54,693
Wait, Becky. What are you doing?
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo-roo-roo.

750
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:59,982
Okay. I was going somewhere.
The question is where.

751
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,819
Which way? Do you see the sign?

752
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:05,404
I'm looking. I'm looking. Something to
something gets me to my family!

753
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,121
"The world's most powerful pair of..."

754
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,240
I know that. Why do I know that?
It's another memory.

755
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,040
Hank, we need to go that way!
Left. Go left.

756
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,457
Becky! Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

757
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,836
She can't hear you, Dad.

758
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:26,843
All right. New plan. We have to get
closer to Becky so she can hear us.

759
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,683
I don't think we should move the pail.

760
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:33,854
Nemo. Without me Becky's lost.

761
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,019
Dad, just trust her.

762
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,061
Trust her? So she can forget us
all together?

763
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,859
- I trust Becky.
- You trust her? Becky's eating a cup!

764
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,200
Becky! Becky! Ooo-roo! Whoa!

765
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,043
Ah.

766
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,254
Well, at least we're not stuck
in the bucket any more.

767
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,551
Or on top of quarantine.

768
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,300
The baby otter talk is beginning now.

769
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:12,887
Why, thanks, Sigourney Weaver.
Hey, who wants to learn about otters?

770
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,389
Looking for the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

771
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:17,885
Otters!

772
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,150
- Welcome, it's a huge cuddle party!
- Cuddle party! I'm in!

773
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,067
Where are we? Are we close to Open Ocean?

774
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,614
Uh, yes. I think... Well, I don't know.
But I saw that other sign so...

775
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,738
What? What other sign?

776
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,244
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.

777
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,115
What? What are you talking about?
Why would we follow that sign?

778
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,452
Well, because I remembered it.

779
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,327
No. That wasn't the plan. Ow!

780
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,334
All right, that's it!
You have wasted my time!

781
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,497
- Wait. No.
- That transport truck leaves at dawn...

782
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,460
and I'm not missing it,
so give me your tag.

783
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,090
Wait. No, I remembered that sign.

784
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:49,837
- So?
- So I'm remembering more...

785
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,255
and more and I feel like my memory's
getting better. I think we should...

786
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,097
No! Your memory is not working.
You can't remember anything.

787
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:57,934
It's probably how you lost your family
in the first place!

788
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:04,691
All right, look, let's just take it down
a notch. Just give me the tag and...

789
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:08,107
You know something, for a guy
with three hearts you're not very nice.

790
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:10,487
Three hearts? What are you talking
about? I don't have three hearts.

791
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,741
- Yes, you do.
- I don't!

792
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:12,612
- You do!
- Don't!

793
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,911
- Do!
- Stop saying that!

794
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,162
Fun fact... the octopus has three hearts.

795
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,454
Two pump blood to the gills
while the third pumps...

796
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,910
- blood throughout the body.
- Wait!

797
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,288
Whoa!

798
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,840
You know, someone with three hearts
shouldn't be so mean.

799
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,380
And it's mean to say that
I would lose someone I love!

800
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,891
I did not lose them! Hank?

801
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,850
Hank? Hank?

802
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,310
- Han-s.
- No. Not Hans. I'm looking for Hank.

803
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,646
- Han-s.
- Hank. With a "k." Hank.

804
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,942
- Hands!
- Hands? Oh, oh, oh, hands!

805
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,607
Hank! Hank?

806
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:53,698
My arm!

807
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,490
Hank!

808
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,992
Where are you? Hank!

809
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,787
Oh! Ahh! Can you please help me?
I'm looking for...

810
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,336
Please help me. I've lost
my friend Frank. I'm sorry, not Frank.

811
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,591
You're in my space!

812
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,053
He's an octopus. No, septo...
Septopus. That's right.

813
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,804
He's a septopus. Septopus.
Septopus. Septopus.

814
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:16,894
One, two, three, four, five, six, s...
Septopus! He's camouflaged!

815
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,265
Hank. Come on, Hank!
Let's get out of here.

816
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,024
Dory, what are you doing?

817
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,899
Hank! What's the plan?

818
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,185
The plan is I'm gonna stay here forever.

819
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,649
Okay. Good plan.

820
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:37,235
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry.
I can't remember right.

821
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,991
- Sweetie. Sweetie.
- Oh, watch out, kelpcake.

822
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,368
Oh, watch where you're going.

823
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:46,575
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.

824
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:51,208
Oh, sweetie.
Sweetie, you don't need to be sorry.

825
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,800
You know what you need to do?
Just keep swimming.

826
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,967
Yeah.

827
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,255
And I bet you can remember
that because we're just...

828
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,722
Um...

829
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:03,227
We're gonna sing a song about it.

830
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:06,232
# Just keep swimming
Just keep swimming

831
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:08,935
# Just keep swimming
Swimming, swimming

832
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,976
# What do we do?
We swim

833
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,069
# Swim, swim, swim
We swim

834
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,816
- # We swim, swim, swim
- # Just keep swimming #

835
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,536
My parents taught me that song!

836
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:22,988
We sang it as a family.

837
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,581
All this time I thought I made it up!

838
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,416
- What song?
- Just keep swimming.

839
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,581
Hank, we've just got to keep swimming.

840
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,050
What? No way! Listen to me,
it's too dangerous to move.

841
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,010
No, you listen to me. I know
you're scared, but you can't give up.

842
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:36,172
Follow me.

843
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,801
# Just keep swimming
Just keep swimming

844
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,348
# My mom wrote this song for me

845
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,273
# It's gonna get us out of here #

846
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:46,854
Sing with me, Hank. Come on.

847
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,805
I'm coming, Mommy. I'm coming, Daddy!

848
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,608
- We're gonna be okay.
- Stop!

849
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,153
- Huh?
- Turn back.

850
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,475
Turn back!

851
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,531
You're headed right for Poker's Cove.

852
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,492
Poker's Cove.

853
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,328
- Poker's Cove?
- Incoming!

854
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:06,964
Stop it!

855
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:08,622
Oh, what is this?

856
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:13,634
Sorry.

857
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,125
That's okay. Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

858
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:24,063
Hank? Oh, Hank. There you are.

859
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,390
Wow. You got us out of there.

860
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,229
Huh. I did.

861
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,228
I got us out of there.

862
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:35,361
I mean, technically
you also got us in there.

863
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,529
But if you hadn't I'm not sure
we would have gotten here.

864
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,043
Echolocation. Echolocation!

865
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:48,622
The world's most powerful pair
of glasses. We found it!

866
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,867
No. You found that.

867
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,009
Welcome to the Open Ocean.

868
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:01,088
Home.

869
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:08,345
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo.
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

870
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:10,435
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

871
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,272
Dad, stop. She's not coming back.

872
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,897
She might. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo!

873
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,110
Dad! You made her feel like
she couldn't do it.

874
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,198
You're not talking about Becky, are you?

875
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:28,906
I miss Dory.

876
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:30,788
Me too.

877
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,800
The truth is,
I'm just so worried about her.

878
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:40,377
She's the one who should be worried
about us.

879
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,049
Well, she would definitely have an idea
of what to do if she were here.

880
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,390
I don't know how she does that.

881
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:50,385
I don't think she knows, Dad.
She just does.

882
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,229
Well, then we'll just have to think.

883
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:56,903
- What would Dory do?
- What would Dory do?

884
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,975
Yeah! What would Dory do?

885
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,451
She would assess her situation,
and then she'd evaluate...

886
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,322
then she would analyse her options...

887
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,079
Dad, that's "what would Marlin do."

888
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,580
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.

889
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,834
She would just look at the first thing
she sees and...

890
00:47:24,593 --> 00:47:25,763
Dory would do it.

891
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:28,679
Mmm.

892
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,682
Nemo, hold on to me.

893
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:32,766
Whoa!

894
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:36,522
Whoo-hoo!

895
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:37,805
Hey, it's working! Whoa!

896
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,280
Just keep gasping.

897
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,828
- Are you okay?
- Yeah! What would Dory do now?

898
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,039
Who's Dory?

899
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,455
Oh, boy. Are we happy to see you.

900
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,875
Happy to see me? I'm happy to see you!

901
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,678
I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.

902
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,512
Years? Wow.

903
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,724
Unfortunately we can't stay long.
We have to go because...

904
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:12,518
Now why would you want to go?
You just landed.

905
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,642
Stay a while. Tell me all about yourself.

906
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,520
I would love to, but my son and I
have to get to quarantine, so...

907
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,728
- Wonderful thing to have a son.
- Yeah it is.

908
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,989
Of course I don't have a family.
I dated a nice scallop for a while.

909
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,992
- That's fascinating, but...
- But scallops have eyes.

910
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,204
And she was looking for something
different. I'm kidding!

911
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:30,325
Well, not about scallops having eyes.
They do.

912
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,742
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.

913
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:37,251
Oh, Shelley! Why? Why?

914
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,745
Now what would Dory do?

915
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,375
Come with us as we explore

916
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,507
the mysterious world of the Open Ocean.

917
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,677
- Okay, Hank, follow me.
- You're in a cup.

918
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,264
Right. I'll follow you then.

919
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,525
- Wait.
- An octopus has three hearts.

920
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:08,907
Huh. That's a fun fact.

921
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,629
We're here. This is really happening.

922
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:22,789
Sh!

923
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:36,773
Well, looks like this is it, kid.
Now I got a truck to catch.

924
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:39,273
Wait! Wait! I had something for you.

925
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:45,071
- Tag.
- The tag. Right!

926
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:55,238
You know, I think I'm gonna remember you.

927
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:00,082
Oh, you'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.

928
00:50:00,582 --> 00:50:01,832
Three heartbeats.

929
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:04,838
I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.

930
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:11,968
My parents are actually down there.

931
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:17,563
Um...

932
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,770
You okay?

933
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:21,188
I'm ready.

934
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,766
Yeah, I think you are.

935
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,106
Whoa!

936
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:31,948
Wow!

937
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:39,945
Where are they? Where are they?
Where are they? Okay. Okay.

938
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:50,757
Pardon me. Oh. Hi. Hello. Have you
seen a mom and a dad without me?

939
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,684
Excuse me. Have you seen a couple?

940
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:53,969
They're old like you.

941
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,675
Not old like you, but older than you even.

942
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,813
Okay. Bye.

943
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:03,142
Hi. Do you know anyone who lost a kid
a long time ago that would be me?

944
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,441
I don't know how long ago exact...
Okay. You're in a hurry.

945
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,784
- Ho, ho! Watch where you're going.
- Oh, sorry.

946
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:19,372
It's our goal that every animal
we rescue and care for...

947
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,996
will eventually return home
to where they belong.

948
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,171
Shells.

949
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:32,296
And there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, Dory...

950
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,215
You just follow the shells.

951
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:35,844
Hey, look! Shells!

952
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,478
Follow the shells.

953
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:00,155
- Hey, I live there.
- Yes, yes indeed.

954
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,664
My home. That's my home!

955
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,829
Mom! Dad!

956
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,046
Okay, kelpcake. Now count to ten.

957
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,551
One, two, three...

958
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,796
Four...

959
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,715
You're welcome.

960
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,597
Who are you talking to, kelpcake?

961
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,524
My pipe pal, Destiny!

962
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,395
Mom? Dad?

963
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,284
Mommy loves purple shells.

964
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,915
- Mommy?
- What's going to happen to her?

965
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,837
There, there, Jenny.

966
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,013
Oh, no, don't cry, Mommy. Don't cry.

967
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,182
Do you think she's... That she can
make it on her own, Charlie?

968
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:04,222
Oh, honey. It'll be okay.

969
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,774
Mommy loves purple shells.

970
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,570
- Dory!
- Dory?

971
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,330
- Dory!
- Mommy?

972
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,406
- Dory!
- Mommy! Daddy!

973
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,002
My parents...

974
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:34,503
I... I lost them.

975
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,810
It was my fault.

976
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:47,477
- Where's your tag?
- Huh?

977
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:51,442
Your tag. It's missing.
That why you're not in quarantine?

978
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:52,732
- Quarantine?
- Yeah!

979
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,975
That's where they took all
the blue tangs. Isn't that right, Bill?

980
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,150
Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

981
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,490
Being shipped out on a truck
at the crack of dawn. Must be nice.

982
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,945
What? No! No, my parents
are back in quarantine?

983
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:07,868
They're being shipped to Cleveland?
But I just got here!

984
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,707
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.

985
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,332
Don't worry,
it's easy to get to quarantine.

986
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,170
You can just go through the pipes, honey.

987
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:19,094
Oh. Oh, I can't do that.

988
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:22,299
- Why not?
- I'll forget where I'm going.

989
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,638
And I can't be somewhere
where I have nobody to help me.

990
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:28,675
- Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
- You're not helping, Bill.

991
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,350
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.

992
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:36,483
Oh, boy.

993
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:40,986
Could you tell me how to get there?
Through the pipes?

994
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:45,164
Sure, honey. It's two lefts
and then a right. Simple.

995
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:50,662
Okay.

996
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:55,544
Two lefts and a right. I can do this.

997
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,550
Two lefts and a right. Okay. Don't forget.

998
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,345
Two lefts and a right.
Two lefts and a right.

999
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:11,390
Two lefts and a right. Two lefts
and a right. Two lefts and a right.

1000
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:17,229
Two lefts and a right? Shoot.

1001
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:22,361
Left and a right. Wait.
Did I already take a left?

1002
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,867
Oh, no. It's happening. Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1003
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:30,911
Which way? Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.

1004
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,658
Okay. I'm lost. It's too hard.
I can't remember.

1005
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:33,917
I'm forgetting everything.

1006
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,921
I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes! The pipe pals.

1007
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:40,594
Pipe pals? Pipe pals!

1008
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:44,295
- And... swim, swim, swim.
- Yeah, I don't know about this.

1009
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,837
Trust me,
I won't let you hit anything. Wall!

1010
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,974
What's the point?
I'll never learn to get around!

1011
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:52,806
You better! If you can't do it in here
you'll never do it out in the ocean.

1012
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:55,142
Now really focus, okay? Wall!

1013
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:56,811
Destiny!

1014
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,769
Dory? Hello?

1015
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,650
I'm lost in the pipes
and my parents are in quarantine!

1016
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:06,159
Hang on, Dory! Bailey!
You've got to use your echolocation!

1017
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:07,162
You know it's broken!

1018
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,783
Just stop it, and try the "Ooh" thing
Dory talked about, will you?

1019
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:11,949
- But I don't think I can...
- Don't bail on me, Bailey!

1020
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,997
Ooh!

1021
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,460
Ooh! Ooh!

1022
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,626
Come on, Bailey. What did you
just tell me, huh? Really focus!

1023
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,166
Ooh! I feel stupid.

1024
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,469
- Bailey.
- Sorry. Ooh!

1025
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,093
- Hello?
- Here!

1026
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,136
We're here!

1027
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,933
- Guys... Ooh! Guys... Ooh!
- What? What is it?

1028
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:37,225
I'm getting something! Ooh!
Here we go! Ooh! Oh, yes! Ooh!

1029
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:41,984
I can see the quarantine! This is amazing!

1030
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:46,068
Ooh! I can see everything!
And I can see you!

1031
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,953
He can see you!

1032
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:50,034
My life's a rainbow! Can you see me?

1033
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:52,196
Right, it doesn't work that way.

1034
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,498
- Bailey!
- Okay! Tell Dory to go left!

1035
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,042
He says go left!

1036
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,575
Left?

1037
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,418
- Ooh! Straight!
- Straight!

1038
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,342
- Straight!
- Ooh! Go right!

1039
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,174
- Right!
- Right!

1040
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:09,047
Ooh! I'm light-headed! Ooh! Wait. Ooh!

1041
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,508
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on! Let me zoom out.

1042
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,256
Zzz...

1043
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,467
Holy Neptune, she's not alone! Ooh!

1044
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:17,638
- What is it?
- I can't tell! But it's coming for her.

1045
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:21,358
Oh, no! Dory, swim! Swim the other way!

1046
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:22,942
- What? Where?
- What? Where?

1047
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,605
- Go right!
- Right!

1048
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:29,031
No, my right!
Oh, no! She's heading right towards it!

1049
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,026
No! Dory, turn around!

1050
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,367
That's great, Dory!
You're headed right toward us!

1051
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,196
What? You want me to go right?

1052
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,790
No! No! Not right. Oh, I can't look!

1053
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,554
- Dory!
- Marlin?

1054
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,050
- I knew it! You're okay!
- Oh, my gosh!

1055
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,053
It's consuming her! It's eating her alive!

1056
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:54,219
- You're okay!
- You found me! How did you find me?

1057
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,558
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.

1058
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:59,894
We just slowly backed away from him
and into these pipes.

1059
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,561
And then we just started looking.

1060
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,399
Dory! I'm sorry!

1061
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,065
Okay, what was that?

1062
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,573
Hang on. I got to take this.

1063
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,445
It's okay! Sorry for what?

1064
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,571
What? You're okay?

1065
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,240
- Yes!
- I found Marlin and Nemo!

1066
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:18,119
Dad! Did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.

1067
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,367
I heard.

1068
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:22,035
It's bringing back some very bad
memories so let's get out of here.

1069
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:26,048
I say we go this way.
Follow me. It's time to head home!

1070
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:30,007
Wait, wait, wait! Um...
My parents are here.

1071
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,932
- They are?
- You found your parents?

1072
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:36,433
Well, not exactly. No. I mean not yet,
but, um, I know where they are.

1073
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:40,887
I don't know exactly how to get there,
but I know that... I'm getting help...

1074
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,770
- Down to quarantine.
- Quarantine.

1075
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:46,607
That's it! Oh, and I met
this septopus, super cranky...

1076
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:51,784
but secretly kind of sweet, and he
got me into the exhibit... The exhibit.

1077
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,281
Dory?

1078
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,287
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?

1079
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,792
What? Why wouldn't they want to see you?

1080
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:04,792
Because... I lost them?

1081
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:09,763
Dory, your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.

1082
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,629
They're going to have missed...
everything about you.

1083
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,141
- Really?
- Do you know how we found you?

1084
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,143
- Something about a clam? Or...
- No.

1085
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,135
- No, an oyster.
- No.

1086
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,346
- Mollusc?
- No.

1087
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:21,176
- Something?
- No.

1088
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,600
- I don't... No?
- No clam.

1089
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,478
We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...

1090
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,646
"What would Dory do?"

1091
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,482
Why would you say that?

1092
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,650
Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...

1093
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:37,030
stuff I never dreamed of doing.
Crazy things!

1094
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:41,367
Outsmarting sharks and jumping jellyfish.

1095
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:46,828
And finding my son.
You made all that happen.

1096
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:52,884
Really? I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.

1097
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:57,343
No, you didn't forget. I never told you.

1098
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,349
And I'm sorry about that.

1099
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:08,481
But, Dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.

1100
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:16,033
And when you do that, you'll be home.

1101
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,042
Dad.

1102
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:33,261
Does this mean
we have to say goodbye to Dory?

1103
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,224
Yes, Nemo. We do.

1104
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,239
Hey, so how much more we got left to load?

1105
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,906
Uh, just this last row.

1106
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,445
The sooner we finish, the sooner
this truck gets to Cleveland.

1107
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,211
- Watch the turn.
- Watch what? Ow!

1108
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,212
- Too late.
- Okay, I think we're close. Whee!

1109
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,551
Hi!

1110
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:13,800
Is this quarantine?

1111
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,759
Yes! This is it! We're in quarantine!

1112
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:18,343
My parents are here!

1113
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,675
Where are we going? Hey, what...

1114
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,930
No, why are we going towards the door?

1115
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,305
- We are all better!
- Yay!

1116
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:25,099
I feel fantastic!

1117
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:27,727
Dude.

1118
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:33,147
My family! Come on, let's go! Excuse me.

1119
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:34,402
Dory, wait a minute!

1120
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:41,617
I'm coming Mommy! I'm coming Daddy!

1121
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:45,615
Whoo-hoo! Almost home.
Almost home. I'm almost home.

1122
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,414
I think I'm getting the hang of this! Oh!

1123
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,711
I hear footsteps.

1124
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,840
- Hank!
- Quiet.

1125
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,470
Hank, we need to get in that tank.
That rhymed.

1126
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,474
- Why?
- Her parents are there!

1127
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:03,925
Oh.

1128
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:07,983
Look, you've got three minutes
to get everyone in this cup with you...

1129
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,982
and then I'm on that truck
to Cleveland, got it?

1130
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,024
Got it.

1131
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:16,784
Oh, boy.

1132
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,948
Mom? Dad?

1133
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:27,445
Mom? Dad? Hey, everybody. It's me, Dory!

1134
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,172
Dory? Dory? Dory?
Jenny and Charlie's Dory? Dory?

1135
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,000
Mom? Dad?

1136
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,344
Mom? Dad?

1137
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,630
Mom? Dad?

1138
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,178
- She should just pick 2 and let's go.
- Dad.

1139
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:44,763
What? I'm kidding. It's a reunion.

1140
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:48,677
Mom? Dad? Where are my parents?

1141
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,773
Dory? Are you really
Jenny and Charlie's girl?

1142
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:55,855
Yes, I am! That's me! Where are they?

1143
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,191
Uh, well, Dory, right after
you disappeared, they thought you...

1144
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,700
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.

1145
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,700
- Uh-huh?
- Come on, come on, come on.

1146
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:09,374
And so they came here to look for you.

1147
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,206
They're here! Where are they?

1148
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:17,039
Dory, that was years ago.

1149
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,051
- Huh?
- They never came back.

1150
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:21,302
Oh, no.

1151
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:25,803
You see, Dory, when fish
don't come back from quarantine...

1152
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,138
it means they're not...

1153
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:29,767
What?

1154
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,601
Dory, they're gone.

1155
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:35,055
They're dead?

1156
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:39,403
-They wanted to find you...
- Wait. Are you sure they're gone?

1157
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,364
Dory, listen, it's going to be okay.

1158
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:43,898
Dory, they loved you so much.

1159
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:46,911
Anyone not looking to go to Cleveland,
final warning!

1160
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:52,448
- Dory, are you all right?
- Are you okay?

1161
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,749
- I was too late.
- Dory, no. No. Now listen.

1162
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:59,746
- I don't have a family.
- No, Dory. That's not true.

1163
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:02,631
Time to go!

1164
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,628
I'm all alone.

1165
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,300
- Dory.
- Dory!

1166
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:09,974
Where's everybody else?

1167
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,431
Your orange friends are on their way
to Cleveland. Ah!

1168
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,270
I found the octopus!

1169
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:17,772
Where did he go?

1170
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,743
Mommy? Daddy?

1171
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:36,289
Help.

1172
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:42,625
No. No. No. Help. Help. Help me.

1173
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:48,136
Help. Help me. Please. Somebody help me!

1174
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,850
Hey, can... Help me?
Can you help me? I've lost them!

1175
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:55,354
- Oh. Lost who?
- I-I-I-I...

1176
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,347
Ah, sorry, honey. I can't help you
if you don't remember.

1177
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,609
Uh...

1178
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:04,864
Oh! Can you help me? I've lost... them.

1179
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,357
Uh, can you be more specific?

1180
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,778
My... My... Them! Them! Them!

1181
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:10,986
Um... Um...

1182
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:13,993
Oh...

1183
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,659
Help! Help!

1184
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,786
Please? They're gone!

1185
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:40,981
I've lost... I've lost everyone.
There's nothing I can do.

1186
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:47,355
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting? Something.

1187
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,235
Something important. What was it? I...

1188
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:56,373
What was it? It's going away.

1189
01:05:57,204 --> 01:06:01,214
It's going away. It's going because
all I can do is forget. I just forget.

1190
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,495
And I forget.
That's what I do best. That's what I do.

1191
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:11,389
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

1192
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,057
What would Dory do?

1193
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,564
I would look around.

1194
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:25,902
And, um, there's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.

1195
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,570
Kelp is better. Okay.

1196
01:06:34,283 --> 01:06:38,873
Okay. Now what? Lots of kelp.
It looks the same.

1197
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:44,585
It all looks the same,
except there's a rock... over there.

1198
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:50,222
And some sand this way.
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

1199
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,439
Oh, this isn't going anywhere.

1200
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:14,658
There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp. Lots of kelp.

1201
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:18,953
And some shells... this way.

1202
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,617
I like shells.

1203
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,587
I like... shells.

1204
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:56,277
Whoa.

1205
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,315
Hello. I'm...

1206
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,735
- Dory!
- Dory! You're here.

1207
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,657
- Oh, my baby!
- You're really here.

1208
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:41,866
- Let me look at you.
- You found us.

1209
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,195
- I'm never letting you go again.
- Oh, my missing girl, you're here.

1210
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:45,369
- My baby!
- It's you.

1211
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:49,209
- Yes! Oh, absolutely!
- It's really you! Mom, you're here.

1212
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:52,046
- I am, I...
- And Dad, so are you.

1213
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:53,669
Right here, kelpcake.

1214
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,887
I'm so sorry.

1215
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,722
Oh, honey. Oh, honey, no. Kelpcake.

1216
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:05,558
I know I've got a problem. I know I'm...
And I'm so sorry.

1217
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:09,806
And all this time I've wanted to fix it
and I can't and I try. I try.

1218
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,726
But my thoughts... they leave my head
and ideas change.

1219
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,029
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.

1220
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:20,243
Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.
Look what you did.

1221
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,077
- What?
- You found us!

1222
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,004
That's right. You found us.

1223
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,957
Honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?

1224
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:34,956
Because we believed one day
you'd find us again.

1225
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,258
Exactly!

1226
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:39,925
But I thought you were gone.
How did you...

1227
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:43,060
We went into quarantine
to look for you, but you weren't there.

1228
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,221
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

1229
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,601
Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie.
And so we did too.

1230
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:52,609
And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.

1231
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:55,113
- We thought you might come back.
- We stayed and waited for you.

1232
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,275
So every day, we go out and lay out...

1233
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,317
Shells.

1234
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:10,616
And you found us. Oh, honey, you found us.

1235
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:13,291
And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.

1236
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:19,756
You remembered
in your own, amazing, Dory way.

1237
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,140
I did. All by myself.

1238
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:30,805
Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?

1239
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,647
Oh, my poor little girl.

1240
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:36,483
Oh, I haven't been all by myself...
Marlin and Nemo!

1241
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,779
- Nobody saw where Dory went?
- No. Sorry. I didn't see anything.

1242
01:10:39,945 --> 01:10:42,855
Seriously? That's a lot
of eyeballs doing nothing.

1243
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:44,695
Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

1244
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,366
- We're looking...
- Me help you?

1245
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,003
Dad, look! It's Dory.

1246
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:56,594
Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
I knew she'd find a way... What?

1247
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:58,132
Hey, where's Dory? Is she with you?

1248
01:10:58,213 --> 01:11:00,303
I'm sorry.

1249
01:11:00,382 --> 01:11:03,342
I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.

1250
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,428
- What?
- All right. Let's get going.

1251
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:06,724
No!

1252
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,388
And then the whale swallowed us
even though I speak whale.

1253
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,434
A whale?

1254
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:11,637
Good thing I wasn't there to see that.

1255
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,647
Actually Marlin never believes
I even know how to speak whale...

1256
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,692
but you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

1257
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,356
You know, I like this Marlin already.

1258
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,994
Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?

1259
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,572
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

1260
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:24,448
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

1261
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:25,701
Um, what would Dory do?

1262
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:28,656
Well, we'll certainly have to thank
Marlin and Nemo when we meet them.

1263
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,373
Wait. Wait I know this place.

1264
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:35,581
Hello. I'm Sigourney Weaver.

1265
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,499
- There!
- Won't you please join us?

1266
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,550
- That's the Marine Life Institute.
- Oh, you were born there.

1267
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:42,545
Dory, is that where your friends are?

1268
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:46,756
Yes! They were stuck in something.
It was going somewhere.

1269
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,814
A truck. They're in the truck!

1270
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,890
That means I could...
Never see them again!

1271
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,098
No! No, no, no. What would Dory do?

1272
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:59,231
Uh, I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.

1273
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,567
Please! Please.
All I know is that I miss them. I... I...

1274
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:07,566
I really miss them. I've said that before.

1275
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,075
Um...

1276
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:11,242
Dory?

1277
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:16,079
Mom, Marlin and Nemo are more
than good friends, they're family.

1278
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:20,129
And I have to get them back.
See, when they found me it felt like fate.

1279
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,923
Do you know what I mean? Or... I don't...
What's another word for fate?

1280
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,179
Like destiny. Destiny?

1281
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,969
Destiny!

1282
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,390
- Dory?
- Destiny!

1283
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:33,805
- Morning, Dest...
- Sh. It's Dory. Something's wrong.

1284
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:38,942
Ooh. I got her.
She's right outside the institute.

1285
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:41,902
- Destiny?
- We got to jump.

1286
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:43,647
- Jump?
- No time to argue!

1287
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:45,277
Destiny!

1288
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:48,283
Dory! The truck thing
with your friends is leaving!

1289
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:50,238
No, no. Destiny.

1290
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,575
Oh, no! That's bad! What do we do?

1291
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:56,118
- All right.
- Yes.

1292
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,789
- Here we go. One. Two.
- Yes. Yes.

1293
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,787
I can't! I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there.

1294
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,464
Destiny! I've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

1295
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,301
You've got the world's
most powerful pair of glasses.

1296
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:07,796
I will be your eyes.

1297
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:10,298
You can be my eyes. But the walls!

1298
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:12,508
There are no walls in the ocean!

1299
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:16,269
- No walls?
- It's your destiny, Destiny.

1300
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,443
Well, why didn't you say so?

1301
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:21,943
What? No! Destiny, wait!
No, that's a wall! Wall!

1302
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,030
Mom, Dad, this is my pipe pal.
Destiny, say hi.

1303
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:32,078
Dory! Are these little blue blobs
your parents?

1304
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,538
They look just like you!

1305
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,832
Hello. I'm Bailey. Mrs Dory, Mr Dory.

1306
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:38,367
- Oh, please, call me Jenny.
- Oh, and I'm Charlie.

1307
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,380
Okay. Okay. We got to go.
We got to stop that truck.

1308
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:41,881
Okay, what truck?

1309
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,011
Bailey, status report.

1310
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:49,342
Oh, yes, my beautiful gift. Ooh.

1311
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:51,679
Found it! The truck's merging
onto the freeway

1312
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,181
and it's heading south. Ooh.

1313
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:55,636
Let's go. We are stopping that truck.

1314
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:59,808
- This I've got to see.
- Yeah, yeah, me too!

1315
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,940
Oh, boy, this is gonna be good!

1316
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,483
What the... Gerald!
Have you lost your marbles?

1317
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,150
- Don't get used to it, Gerald!
- Cheeky joke.

1318
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,244
Bailey, I forgot everything. Catch me up.

1319
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:16,368
Yes, ma'am. Ooh.
Your friends are still on the truck.

1320
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,076
Ooh. They're headed north
towards the bridge. Ooh.

1321
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,577
Oh, look, there's a bunch of
cute otters over there.

1322
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,128
I want one! Ow!

1323
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:27,923
Ow, Bailey!

1324
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:30,086
Oh! I see the truck. It's over there.

1325
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:31,928
- Okay, what would Dory do?
- I don't see how we can get on it.

1326
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,103
Oh, man, if only there was a way
to stop traffic.

1327
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,852
Stop traffic. Stop traffic!
Everyone needs to stop.

1328
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:37,965
People stop to look at things.

1329
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:39,178
Things that they like.
Things that are cute.

1330
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:42,654
Things that are cute! Okay, I got it.

1331
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,439
- What? What is it?
- Quickly before I forget.

1332
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:47,226
Destiny, when the truck reaches
the bridge you flip me up there.

1333
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:47,980
Got it.

1334
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,899
You guys, follow me.
Everyone else, stay here.

1335
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:54,621
Whoa. Dory.
Honey, you're not leaving us again.

1336
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,453
Your mother's right.
You have to stay with us.

1337
01:14:56,618 --> 01:15:00,458
Dory, what happens if...
You know, if you're gone for too long.

1338
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,332
And what if you get confused and that
makes you distracted. And what if...

1339
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:04,748
I lose you again?

1340
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:07,377
Oh. Yes.

1341
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,628
Mom, Dad, it's gonna be okay because...

1342
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,600
I know that even if I forget
I can find you again.

1343
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,651
Ooh. Okay a little left. Ooh.
Back the other way a bit.

1344
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,942
Ooh. Okay, that's it. Go! Don't do it.

1345
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:28,266
- Bailey!
- Okay, now! Now! Do it! Do it!

1346
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,610
- Time for your idea.
- Okay. What idea?

1347
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,249
Okay. What do I do? What would Dory do?

1348
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:43,751
Come on, cars, cars. I see cars.
Otters in front of cars.

1349
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,793
Cars have to stop.
Stop traffic! Cuddle party!

1350
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,381
Look out!

1351
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:54,014
They're so cute!

1352
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:57,054
Look at them! There must be one, two...

1353
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,933
- What's going on, Dad?
- I don't know how.

1354
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:05,981
I don't know in what way, but I think
this has something to do with...

1355
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:12,492
- Dory!
- Water. Water. I need water.

1356
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:13,782
Are you crazy? How'd you get here?

1357
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,950
- Dory!
- Oh!

1358
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,833
- I thought we'd never see you again.
- Aw, me too.

1359
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:23,083
But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried
I just couldn't forget you.

1360
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,750
I guess I missed the rest of my family
too much, huh?

1361
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,585
- We're family?
- Mm-hmm.

1362
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:31,169
Do you know what that feels like?

1363
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:34,674
Yes, I know what that feels like.

1364
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,175
Aw!

1365
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,683
Hey! Hey, come on. Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo!

1366
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:43,387
- Oh, no. There goes our ride.
- Back in the water. Come on.

1367
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,516
Dory, the traffic is starting to move.

1368
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:48,305
Leave it to me. I got this.

1369
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:51,266
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo.

1370
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,607
Becky! Becky, come back.
We need your help! Becky!

1371
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:57,741
Dory, follow me.

1372
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:02,413
No, no, wait. We don't have Dory!
No, no, Becky wait! Stop it.

1373
01:17:02,577 --> 01:17:07,367
We need to go back. Becky, back!
Back, Becky! Loo-loo. Ooo-roo-roo.

1374
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:09,707
- Please don't eat us!
- Where's Dory?

1375
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,496
- Who are you?
- Jenny?

1376
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:12,838
- Marlin?
- Charlie?

1377
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:13,961
Nemo? Thank you so much.

1378
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:16,837
Thank you for taking care of Dory.

1379
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,928
Dory! She's still in the truck.

1380
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:22,893
Becky! Fetch Dory! Ooo-roo. Dor-roo.

1381
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:28,561
Okay, kid. I guess this is goodbye.

1382
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:29,896
- No!
- What do you mean, "No"?

1383
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:32,523
You're not going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to the ocean with me.

1384
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:34,227
What is it with you and ruining my plans?

1385
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:37,397
Listen to me, I have one goal in life.
One! And it is to...

1386
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:41,200
No, you listen to me. What is so great
about plans? I never had a plan.

1387
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:44,872
Did I plan to lose my parents? No.
Did I plan to find Marlin? No.

1388
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:47,656
Did you and I plan to meet? Wait. Did we?

1389
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:49,959
- Are you almost done?
- Well, I don't think we did.

1390
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,923
And that's because the best things
happen by chance. Because that's life.

1391
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:57,626
That's you being with me out
in the ocean not safe in some glass box.

1392
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:58,799
- Can I say something?
- I'm not done!

1393
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:02,095
A friend of mine... Her name's
Sigourney... Once told me that...

1394
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:03,762
all it takes is three simple steps:

1395
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,310
Rescue, rehabilitation,
and one other thing...

1396
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:09,475
Release!

1397
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,772
That's right! So what do you say?

1398
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:14,898
Release! Release! Release!

1399
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:18,356
Release! Release! Release!

1400
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,026
Release! Release! Release!

1401
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,914
I was gonna say, "Okay."

1402
01:18:24,993 --> 01:18:26,333
Not good.

1403
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:28,621
- Oh, no! They're going away!
- Oh, no! Dory! What do we do?

1404
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,286
Quick! Guys, grab my fin!

1405
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:36,127
Ooh! He's trying to get the door open.
Ooh. It's locked from the outside.

1406
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:37,464
Come on, Dory. You can do it.

1407
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,970
Destiny! Destiny! Wall! Wall! Wall!

1408
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:43,851
- Dory, no! Wait!
- Dory!

1409
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:48,022
- Bailey, where are they headed?
- Ooh. I'm losing them.

1410
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:54,397
Dory, it's over.

1411
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,647
- No, there's got to be a way.
- Yeah. There's a way!

1412
01:18:57,817 --> 01:19:00,447
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.

1413
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:02,952
But... There's got to be a way.
There's always a way.

1414
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:06,831
There isn't, Dory. I'm telling you.
This time there is no other way.

1415
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:08,367
Well, what about that?

1416
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:12,328
Holy carp. There is another way.

1417
01:19:12,707 --> 01:19:14,917
Take a deep breath, kid.

1418
01:19:15,043 --> 01:19:17,343
Release! Release! Release!

1419
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:21,133
Release! Release! Release! Release!

1420
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,260
# Your lying eyes... #

1421
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,389
What is that?

1422
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:29,723
I don't care what it is! Get it off!

1423
01:19:30,058 --> 01:19:30,928
What the...

1424
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:33,186
Suck it, bipeds.

1425
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:37,614
All right, Hank, you've got seven arms...
I don't know. Just try something.

1426
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:38,982
Okay. Here we go.

1427
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:44,318
- Huh? Hey! Stop. Stop. Wait! No!
- Hey! Hey! Stop. Wait. Oh, no!

1428
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,197
- That's doing something.
- And we are moving. Good job, Hank.

1429
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:52,285
- Wait, wait, wait! Come on! Whoa!
- Hey! What? Hey! Stop! Wait. Wait.

1430
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:55,713
Listen, I'm not trying to tell you
how to drive. Certainly I can't do...

1431
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,535
I'm not in any position...
But could you go faster?

1432
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,710
No! No, no! No, no, no!

1433
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:05,344
- Whoo!
- Hey! Give us our truck back!

1434
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,048
I can't see squat. Which way are we going?

1435
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,140
Okay. Well, all the cars
are going left so go left.

1436
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,685
Gilman Street. Ashby Avenue. Powell.

1437
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:17,309
Gilman Street again. Huh.
Gilman Street again.

1438
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:19,227
How much longer are we gonna veer left?

1439
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,782
Okay, we just need to know how we got on,

1440
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,202
then we'll know how to get off.

1441
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,872
Well, let me know when you figure it out.

1442
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,580
Unfortunately I can't remember
how we got on.

1443
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,662
Hey, I know those guys!
That's where we came from. Turn right.

1444
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:33,707
Here we go!

1445
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:42,923
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait!
- Oh, my... Whoa. Hey!

1446
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:45,223
We are so fired.

1447
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:50,180
Keep straight. Straight. Left.
Left. No, no, no. Right. Right. Right.

1448
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:53,354
- Good driving, Hank.
- Pay attention to the road.

1449
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,734
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. Uh-oh.
Fork in the road.

1450
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:58,232
- Which way?
- Ocean. Ocean. Hey, a boat!

1451
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,194
You know, I haven't had
great experiences with boats, but I...

1452
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:03,364
- Which way?
- Boats go to the ocean. Right!

1453
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:04,743
Hold on!

1454
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:09,534
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?

1455
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:12,787
Um... Okay, I'll figure it out.
I don't know, but...

1456
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:15,119
Well, something will come and...

1457
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:19,671
Seagulls. Hank, follow those birds!
The ocean's left, Hank.

1458
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:22,707
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

1459
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:25,967
Ooh. Hold on. Ooh. I'm getting something.

1460
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:27,472
Is it them? Is everything perfect?

1461
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,143
Uh-oh, it's the fuzz. Busted.

1462
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:38,142
Okay, we're good. The ocean!
It's straight ahead. Floor it!

1463
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,271
Now we're talking.

1464
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,942
- Oh. Uh-oh!
- What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

1465
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,526
Oh, no. What would I do?
What would I do? What would I do?

1466
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,908
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.

1467
01:21:50,031 --> 01:21:51,701
I'm okay with crazy.

1468
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,618
All right, Hank.

1469
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:57,793
Ooh. There's no way out. It's over.
They're going to fish jail! Ooh!

1470
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:02,955
Wait. Ooh. Oh, no. Ooh. Get back! Incoming!

1471
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:08,165
# I see trees of green

1472
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:13,095
# Red roses too

1473
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,269
# I see them bloom for me and you

1474
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:21,595
# And I think to myself #

1475
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:25,899
Whoo-hoo!

1476
01:22:26,526 --> 01:22:27,526
Whoo-hoo!

1477
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:28,902
Whoo-hoo!

1478
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:33,865
Whoo-hoo!

1479
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:38,543
Fish!

1480
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,838
Dory!

1481
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:46,589
What lies before you

1482
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:48,801
represents the third
and final part of the...

1483
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,179
Marine Life mission.

1484
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:56,512
Rescue, rehabilitation, and release.

1485
01:22:57,265 --> 01:22:59,055
Come to Papa.

1486
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:07,899
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.

1487
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:14,703
One, two, three, four...

1488
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:16,664
Uh...

1489
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,662
Wait a minute. Why am I counting?
Hey, where is everyone?

1490
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:24,037
Uh-oh, did they leave me?
No! No, no. They wouldn't do that.

1491
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:27,088
Okay. That's okay. I can figure this out.
What was I just doing then?

1492
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:31,263
I was, um, covering my face,
so I was trying to hide.

1493
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:33,594
Okay, so why was I trying to hide? Wait!

1494
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,599
Oh, I... Five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

1495
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,138
Ready or not, here I come!

1496
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:38,603
Ha, found you!

1497
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:39,604
- I see you!
- Oh!

1498
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:40,814
Haha! Gotcha!

1499
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:42,935
All right, you little shrimps,
recess is over.

1500
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:45,272
- Aw, man.
- Ah, nobody found me!

1501
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:47,358
Bring it in. Time for another...

1502
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,980
Don't touch me. Time for another lesson.

1503
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:51,650
When is Mr Ray coming back
from his migration?

1504
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,949
If he's smart he'll stay away from here
as long as he can.

1505
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:55,953
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.

1506
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:58,445
Okay kids, who wants to learn
about echolocation?

1507
01:23:58,618 --> 01:23:59,828
- Boo.
- Nobody.

1508
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,252
Oh, come on, guys.
It's actually really cool.

1509
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:03,963
Okay, kelpcake. Have fun.

1510
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,793
Nice day for a swim, huh?

1511
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,788
All right. Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

1512
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,510
Well, I guess we'll go back home
and brush up on the anemone.

1513
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:12,972
You coming, Dory?

1514
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:15,092
Me? Oh, I'm just going to the dropoff.

1515
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:18,755
Oh, okay. What? The dropoff? No!

1516
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:21,016
That's... That's a good idea?

1517
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:24,230
Yeah. I just thought
I'd go enjoy the view. Bye.

1518
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:27,805
The view. Well, you have a good time!

1519
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:32,530
All by yourself. Not getting lost.

1520
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,327
Oh!

1521
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:47,627
Huh?

1522
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:56,183
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
No, no, Dory. Dory. Dory! D...

1523
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:11,358
- Hey, Marlin.
- Oh, hey. Hello, Dory.

1524
01:25:11,524 --> 01:25:12,984
You all right? You look worried.

1525
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,490
No, no, no. I'm fine.
It's how I always look.

1526
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,453
What?

1527
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:24,115
Well, I just...

1528
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:27,290
You did it.

1529
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:31,381
- Yay!
- You did it, kelpcake.

1530
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:34,054
- Yes!
- Did what?

1531
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:39,343
Sweetie, you just followed the shells
all the way back home.

1532
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,718
Oh, my gosh! I did? All by myself?

1533
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:45,177
- Yeah.
- Do you know what this means?

1534
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:50,351
It means you can do
whatever you put your mind to, Dory.

1535
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:51,561
Really?

1536
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:55,896
Mommy, can I go play with them?

1537
01:25:56,569 --> 01:26:00,029
- Yes.
- Absolutely! Go get them, kelpcake.

1538
01:26:05,578 --> 01:26:07,748
Yeah. I did it.

1539
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,421
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1540
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:20,586
It really is quite a view.

1541
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:25,643
Yep.

1542
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:28,891
Unforgettable.

1543
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,998
# Unforgettable

1544
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:58,762
# That's what you are

1545
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:05,848
# Unforgettable

1546
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:11,016
# Tho' near or far

1547
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:18,692
# Like a song of love that clings to me

1548
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:23,657
# How the thought of you does things to me

1549
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:27,952
# Never before

1550
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:33,455
# Has someone been more...

1551
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:37,497
# Unforgettable

1552
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:40,506
# In every way

1553
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:48,431
# And forever more

1554
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:53,847
# That's how you'll stay

1555
01:27:55,813 --> 01:28:00,993
# That's why, darling, it's incredible

1556
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,700
# That someone so unforgettable

1557
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,328
# Thinks that I am

1558
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:12,200
# Unforgettable, too

1559
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,247
# Unforgettable

1560
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:05,045
# In every way

1561
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:12,845
# And forever more

1562
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:16,268
# That's how you'll stay

1563
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:25,357
# That's why, darling, it's incredible

1564
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:30,281
# That someone so unforgettable

1565
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:34,827
# Thinks that I am

1566
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:39,461
# Unforgettable, too #

1567
01:35:25,512 --> 01:35:29,312
Off, off, off, off, off,
off, off, off, off, off!

1568
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:34,444
Come on. Roll, roll. That's it. Hurry!

1569
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:35,811
That's it. Just roll!

1570
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:36,651
I'm right behind you.

1571
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,355
You can do it! Just a little farther.
That's it!

1572
01:35:39,526 --> 01:35:41,696
I am truly going to vomit!

1573
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:44,992
- Voilà!
- All right, gang, good work.

1574
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,661
Look, Flo, we made it!

1575
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:51,407
We won't have any more problems
from here on out.

1576
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:55,331
No respect for ocean life.

1577
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,344
Now what?

1577
01:35:58,305 --> 01:36:04,608
